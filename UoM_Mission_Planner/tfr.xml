!FDC 0/8326 ZDC Flight Restrictions, Washington, DC, effective 1012010401 UTC until further notice. This notice will replace NOTAM 0/9477 due to a change in restrictions. 

This NOTAM and a NOTAM for the Leesburg Maneuvering Area supplement subpart V, 14 CFR part 93 for the Washington, D.C. Special Flight Rules Area (DC SFRA). 

Pursuant to 49 USC 40103(B), The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) classifies the airspace defined in this NOTAM as 'NATIONAL DEFENSE AIRSPACE'. Pilots who do not adhere to the following procedures may be intercepted, detained and interviewed by law enforcement/security personnel. Any of the following additional actions may also be taken against a pilot who does not comply with the requirements or  any special instructions or procedures announced in this NOTAM:
A) The FAA may take administrative action, including imposing civil penalties and the suspension or revocation of airmen certificates; 
or  
B) The United States Government may pursue criminal charges, including charges under title 49 of the United States Code, Section 46307; 
or  
C) The United States Government may use DEADLY FORCE AGAINST THE AIRBORNE AIRCRAFT, if it is determined that the aircraft POSES AN IMMINENT SECURITY THREAT.

1. This notice supplements the DC SFRA with additional guidance and information. 

2. Application of definitions in subpart V, 14 CFR section 93.335: 
	A. The DC Flight Restricted Zone (DC FRZ) flight plan fulfills the requirement for a DC 			SFRA flight plan. A DC FRZ flight plan must be filed with flight service at 866-225-7410. The initiator/pilot must identify themself and use the confidential pilot identification code or their waiver number. 
	B. A DC SFRA flight plan does not fulfill the requirements for visual flight rules (VFR) operations in the DC FRZ. A DC FRZ flight plan is required for VFR operations in the DC FRZ. 
	C. Pilots may not file a DC FRZ flight plan while airborne. 

3. Additions to operating in the DC SFRA 14 CFR section 93.339: 
	A. Aircraft operating in the DC SFRA must be equipped with an operable two way radio capable of communicating with ATC on appropriate radio frequencies or UNICOM. It is highly recommended that a pilot continuously monitor VHF frequency 121.5 or UHF frequency 243.0 for emergency instructions when operating an aircraft in the DC SFRA, either in an aircraft that is suitably equipped, or by use of portable equipment. 
	B. Any person operating an airborne aircraft under VFR within or transiting the DC SFRA/FRZ who is aware of an inability to comply with the requirement to maintain radio contact with ATC must immediately squawk 7600 and exit the DC SFRA/FRZ by the most direct lateral route unless; 
1) The departure point is within the SFRA and the departure point is closer than the SFRA boundary, the pilot may return to the departure point by the most direct route. 
2) If the departure point is within the FRZ and the aircraft is within 5 NM of the departure point, the pilot may return to the departure point by the most direct route. otherwise, the pilot must exit the FRZ via the most direct route. 
	C. Any person operating an airborne aircraft under instrument flight rules (IFR) within or transiting the DC SFRA/FRZ who is aware of an inability to comply with the requirement to maintain radio contact with ATC must continue the flight via the two-way radio communications failure procedures found in the FAA Aeronautical information manual (AIM) or applicable federal aviation regulations (FAR). 
	D. Aircraft departing airports within the SFRA with limited two-way radio communications must establish two-way communications as soon as feasible, normally within 2NM of the departure point. 
	E. Pattern work operations at non-controlled tower airports within the SFRA (but not within the DC FRZ) must be conducted in accordance with 14 CFR SECTION 93.339 (C) and the procedures specified in the most current Potomac TRACON letter to airmen on the subject. The letter can be found at: http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/tracon/pct/ 

4. Additions to operating in the DC FRZ 14 CFR section 93.341. all operations are prohibited within the FRZ (including transit) unless outlined below: 
A. The following operations are not authorized within the DC FRZ: flight training, aerobatic flight,  practice instrument approaches, glider operations, parachute operations, ultra light, hang gliding, balloon operations, tethered balloons, agriculture/crop dusting, animal population control flight operations, banner towing operations, maintenance test flights, model aircraft operations, model rocketry, float plane operations, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and aircraft/helicopters operating from a ship or private/corporate yacht. 
B. It is highly recommended that a pilot continuously monitor VHF frequency 121.5 or UHF frequency 243.0 for emergency instructions when operating an aircraft in the DC FRZ, either in an aircraft that is suitably equipped, or by use of portable equipment. 
C. All air ambulance flights must obtain and comply with an FAA/TSA waiver for operations within the FRZ. 
D. All U.S. state and local law enforcement aircraft must obtain and comply with an FAA/TSA waiver for operations within the FRZ. 
E. DOD operators conducting VFR, rotary wing flights within the FRZ must contact the NCRCC at 866-598-9525 prior to entering the FRZ. 
F. Approved DOD, law enforcement, and lifeguard/air ambulance operators may conduct training/maintenance flights within the DC FRZ with prior approval and coordination with the TSA NCRCC at 866-598-9520.
